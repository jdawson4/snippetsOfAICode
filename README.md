# snippetsOfAICode
Just some snippets of code I've written for various extracurricular AI projects.

I made this repo because I thought it might be a good idea to show that I know how to do some basic concepts in AI/ML/Data Science.

In this repository, you might see things like:
1. Search-based AI
2. Deep learning examples from around the web
3. Maybe some random SKLearn examples?

As of right now, there are a few bits of sample code I've implemented:

1. botClean is an example of a search-based AI I made for a Hackerrank challenge
2. charLSTM implements code from the web: https://analyticsindiamag.com/sequence-to-sequence-modeling-using-lstm-for-language-translation/
3. weatherPredictor implements code from keras' documentation: https://keras.io/examples/timeseries/timeseries_weather_forecasting/
4. keras_CGAN implements another keras documentation walkthrough: https://keras.io/examples/generative/conditional_gan/
