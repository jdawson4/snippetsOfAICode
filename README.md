# snippetsOfAICode
Just some snippets of code I've written for various extracurricular AI projects.

I made this repo because I thought it might be a good idea to show that I know how to do some basic concepts in AI/ML/Data Science.

In this repository, you might see things like:
1. Search-based AI
2. Deep learning examples from around the web
3. Maybe some random SKLearn examples?
